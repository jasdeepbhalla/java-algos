/*
Given a compressed string in which a number followed by [] indicate how many times those characters occur, 
decompress the string.

Eg. : a3[b2[c1[d]]]e will be decompressed as abcdcdbcdcdbcdcde.
Assume the string is well formed and number will always be followed by a [].

/*

Verify if a given matrix is a Toeplitz matrix:
Follow up:
assume that the whole matrix cannot be fit in memory and should be read from a file, 
assume that a few rows and all columns can be read in, how to verify?
