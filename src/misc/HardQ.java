Verify if a given matrix is a Toeplitz matrix:
Follow up:
assume that the whole matrix cannot be fit in memory and should be read from a file, 
assume that a few rows and all columns can be read in, how to verify?

In linear algebra, a Toeplitz matrix or diagonal-constant matrix, 
is a matrix in which each descending diagonal from left to right is constant. 
For instance, the following matrix is a Toeplitz matrix:
9     1     3     2
2     9     1     3
3     2     9     1
1     3     2     9

In general, any n√ón matrix mat[][] is a Toeplitz matrix 
if every cell mat[i][j] is same as mat[i-1][j-1], mat[i+1][j+1], mat[i-2][j-2], mat[i+2][j+2], .. 
for every cell mat[i][j] and all the valid cells mat[i+k][j+k] or mat[i-k][j-k]

The idea is very simple. For each element of first row and first column(or last row and last column) in the matrix, 
we check if descending diagonal starting from that element have same values or not. 
If we found any diagonal having different values, we return false.
