HEAP:

Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list.

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array.

Given an integer array, return the k-th smallest distance among all the pairs. The distance of a pair (A, B) is defined as the absolute difference between A and B.

Given a non-empty string s and an integer k, rearrange the string such that the same characters are at least distance k from each other.

Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.


Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.


Given a n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, find the kth smallest element in the matrix.


Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.


Write a program to find the nth super ugly number.

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 sorted in ascending order and an integer k. Define a pair (u,v) which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array. Find the k pairs (u1,v1),(u2,v2) ...(uk,vk) with the smallest sums.


Design a simplified version of Twitter where users can post tweets, follow/unfollow another user and is able to see the 10 most recent tweets in the user's news feed.

Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.

You are given an integer array sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicates), you need to split them into several subsequences, where each subsequences consist of at least 3 consecutive integers. Return whether you can make such a split.
